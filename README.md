This repository provides a framework and visualization tool to evaluate the consistency of pairwise protein contact predictions from ESM-2 models against multiple sequence alignments (MSA). 

## Key Features
- Fetch PFAM seed alignments by specifying a PFAM ID (e.g. `PF00069`).
- Load & evaluate ESM-2 models of different sizes on chosen pairs of sequences.
- Visualize contact maps and compute consistency scores with adjustable parameters.
