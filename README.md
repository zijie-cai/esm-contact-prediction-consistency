This repository provides a framework and visualization tool to evaluate the consistency of protein contact predictions from ESM-2 models against those derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSA). It allows users to fetch PFAM seed alignments, load and compare various pre-trained ESM-2 models, and interactively adjust confidence and distance thresholds to examine the resulting contact maps and consistency scores.<br><br>

## Key Features
- Fetch PFAM seed alignments by specifying a PFAM ID (e.g. `PF00069`).
- Load & evaluate ESM-2 models of different sizes on chosen pairs of sequences.
- Visualize contact maps and compute consistency scores with adjustable parameters.
