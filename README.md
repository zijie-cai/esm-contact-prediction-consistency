This repository provides a framework and visualization tool to evaluate the consistency of protein contact predictions from ESM-2 models against MSA. 

**Key Features:**
- Fetch and download PFAM seed alignments with ID input (e.g. PF00069)
- Load & evaluate pre-trained ESM-2 models with varying sizes on pairwise sequences
- Visualize contact maps & compute consistency scores with adjustable confidence and distance threshold
