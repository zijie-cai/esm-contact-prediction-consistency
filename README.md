This repository provides an interactive framework and visualization tool for comparing protein contact predictions from ESM-2 models to those derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSA).

**Key Features:**
- **Fetch PFAM Seed Alignments:** Input a PFAM ID (e.g., `PF00069`) to download and analyze corresponding seed alignments.
- **ESM-2 Model Evaluation:** Easily load and compare multiple pre-trained ESM-2 models on selected pairs of sequences.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore contact maps and compute consistency scores, adjusting confidence and distance thresholds in real-time.
